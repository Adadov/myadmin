#Chats

These are fun little chat commands. They include things like /afk, /back, /bbl, /happy, /sad, /mad
You can get a full list of the commands by using /chats

#Curse Words

This is a list of words that are banned on the server. These words can be editted in the settings.txt file.


#Privs

The privs part is a set  of privs for different levels of players. You can set the level with a chat command.

The levels are

Super Admin
Admin
Moderator
Helper
Normal Player
Punish
Unpunish
Silence
Ghost

If you want the available commands do /myadmin_commands
Super admin is not in the list because it is reserved for above admin people but not all privs.


#Spawn

Spawn is an easy way to set spawn locations. In the settings.txt file you can set the chat command and coordinates for the spawn locations.


#Start

Start is the screen that is shown to new players when they join the server. You can list the rules in rules.txt. The player then can  agree to the rules or not.
If the player doess not agree to the rules then he/she will be kicked from the server.


#Extras

Extras are extra neat things that  I would like to see on servers. Right now there is only one extra but I plan on adding more.

/setbar is a command to set the size of the hotbar. You can set it from 1 - 16.
